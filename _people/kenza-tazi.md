biography: I started my PhD in 2020, after completing my MRes as part of the
  CDT. I am co-supervised by Scott Hosking from the Artificial Intelligence Lab
  at the British Antarctic Survey and Richard Turner from the Machine Learning
  Group in the Department of Engineering. My research focuses on applying
  probabilistic machine learning methods to predicting precipitation in
  mountainous areas such as the Himalayas. Before coming to Cambridge, I
  completed an integrated masters in Physics at Imperial College London.
