  Dr Audrey Borowski is a Leverhulme Early Career Fellow and Isaac Newton Trust
  Fellow at the University of Cambridge working on the philosophy of artificial
  intelligence. She was previously a postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Munich
  Centre for Mathematical Philosophy as well as the University of Bonn. She
  completed her doctorate (D.Phil) in the History of Ideas at the University of
  Oxford. Her first monograph *Leibniz in His World: The Making of a Savant* was
  published by Princeton University Press in 2024.


  Since her doctorate, Audrey’s interests have focused more narrowly on the philosophical, conceptual and social underpinnings and ramifications of artificial intelligence and especially algorithmic systems such as machine learning and Generative AI. Since current debates in AI often largely reenact previous ones, Audrey examines how 20th century thought can shed useful light on them and be updated to the current world in a context of growing authoritarianism. Audrey’s current project in particular examines how algorithmic systems tend to compound our current epistemic, political and social crises and threaten shared frameworks of social understanding and action especially through the lens of the philosophical writings of Hannah Arendt, Hans Blumenberg and Theodor Adorno with a view to drawing solutions to help ensure common flourishing and ‘world-building.’
