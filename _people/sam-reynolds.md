  I am working on the application of a novel method of evidence synthesis termed
  ‘dynamic meta-analysis’ to better understand the impacts of invasive species
  on ecosystems and biodiversity, on a local and global scale.


  Meta-analysis is often used to make generalisations across all available evidence at the global scale. However, there is debate over how can these global generalisations can be used for evidence-based decision making at the local scale, especially if the global evidence is not perceived to be relevant to local decisions. I will be developing an interactive method of meta-analysis, which will alter how decision makers can use and assess the local relevance of global evidence.
