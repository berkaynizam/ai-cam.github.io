biography: >-
  I am a Senior Lecturer in the School of Psychology at Manchester Metropolitan
  University, and my interest and expertise are within the area of information
  processing: how language impacts our thinking, reasoning and actions, and how
  we can more generally use information effectively to promote wellbeing.


  More specifically, I am interested in the dissociation between language processing and other high order cognitive skills, and I have specific interest in the processing of numerical information (numerical cognition). In this domain, I am particularly focused on the rehabilitation of acquired numerical deficits (acalculia).


  My interdisciplinary education (BSc in Computer Science and PhD in cognitive neuroscience), enables me to work with a range of data (from qualitative analysis to AI algorithms development) and methods (fMRI, behavioral, neuropsychological cases, etc.) to address the above questions.


  Aside from research, I passionately believe that education can make a difference, and that everyone should be supported, in the way that they need, to achieve their best.
