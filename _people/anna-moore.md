biography: "I am Dr Anna Moore, Assistant Professor in Child Psychiatry and
  Medical Informatics in the Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge.
  My goal is to develop personalised, preventative clinical pathways for
  children’s mental health. I am approaching this by harnessing broad data
  types, including electronic health record, genetic, deep phenotyping and other
  data types relating to children and young people, and making it available for
  research purposes in a shared data environment called CADRE (Child and
  Adolescent Data REsource)
  (https://dareuk.org.uk/sprint-exemplar-project-fair-treatment/ ). CADRE has
  privacy preserving federated analytics capability, enabling access to data
  across a broad geography. This data will be available for use by trusted
  professionals to carry out ethically approved research. I am using this and
  other data to develop a range of novel digital tools to support personalised
  early identification and intervention for childhood mental health conditions.
  This includes exploring the value of different data types, including genetics.
  To enable this, she leads the NIHR BioResource’s D-CYPHR (DNA – children and
  young people’s health resource), the first recallable community of children
  volunteering to get involved in supporting childhood genetics research
  (https://bioresource.nihr.ac.uk/dcyphr/ ). To support these innovations, I am
  addressing a range of important ethical and information governance issues that
  must be addressed with the public and experts in health services research,
  ethics, social sciences and policy makers. To allow meaningful, good quality
  patient and public engagement and involvement, CA:RING (Child and adolescent
  research involvement for the next generation) has been created
  (https://ca-ring.co.uk ). This is a diverse community of over 200 young people
  and parents/guardians from across the country who are passionate about
  supporting paediatric research. CA:RING is a resource available to all
  paediatric researchers (including academic, charitable and industry) who would
  like help to carry out good quality PPIE for their projects. Together, this
  work is enabling the development of novel pathways for early identification
  and intervention which aim to shift child and adolescent mental health
  services towards a preventative approach. I am also currently PI of the NIHR
  Applied Research Collaborative North Thames’ national evaluation of i-THRIVE,
  which is exploring how best to deliver whole system, integrated mental health
  care for children and young people through a 20-site case-control study of
  its’ implementation. I started developing predictive models as part of her
  PhD, which identified which mental health patients were more likely to have a
  longer length of stay in emergency departments. Prior to moving to Cambridge,
  I was Director of Mental Health at UCL Partners where I developed and
  delivered a strategic plan to improve mental health for a population of four
  million by taking a system-wide approach supported by data and informatics.
  During this time I was an NHS Innovation Accelerator Fellow and created and
  led the national CAMHS transformation programme, i-THRIVE – over 70% of
  children in England are now cared for by i-THRIVE services. Happy to hear from
  prospective students: am2708@cam.ac.uk"
