job_title: Henslow Research Fellow
department: Department of Zoology
biography: "Fellowship: My fellowship project has three stands: 1. Finding ways
  to directly combine and assess different forms of evidence (e.g., the
  scientific literature and indigenous and local community knowledge) into
  evidence-based decision-making; 2. Developing new approaches to assessing the
  reliability and relevance of evidence to different decision-making contexts;
  3. Quantifying the generalisability of evidence for different conservation
  actions to understand whether the findings of evidence transfer well between
  different contexts. I want to ensure that in the future, evidence-based
  decision-making combines diverse sources of knowledge for decision-making,
  whilst making sure to assess the reliability and relevance of each piece of
  evidence so we can provide tailored recommendations to decision-makers based
  on their local context."
