  Napoleon Katsos is interested in how experimental research in language
  acquisition and processing can inform theoretical linguistic inquiry and vice
  versa. His particular focus is in the area of semantics and pragmatics,
  especially implicature, presupposition and quantification. Together with
  colleagues, he has been awarded grants by the AHRC, the British Academy, the
  ESRC, and other funding bodies to work on aspects of experimental pragmatics
  with typically- and atypically-developing children and adults.


  Napoleon is also interested in bilingualism, and is a founder member of the Cambridge Bilingualism Network.

  Dr Katsos welcomes inquiries from potential MPhil and PhD students with research interests relevant to his interests.
