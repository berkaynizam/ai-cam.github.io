  Professor Alex Archibald is a Lecturer in Atmospheric Chemistry Modelling in
  the Department of Chemistry at the University of Cambridge, and a Fellow of
  Emmanuel College, Cambridge. His research involves the development and
  application of state-of-the-art chemistry-climate models. With these models
  his group is trying to answer a number of questions relevant to society: (i)
  What are the impacts of changes in man made emissions on the composition of
  the atmosphere (ii) how does the changing composition of the atmosphere affect
  climate (iii) how will a changing climate impact the composition of the
  atmosphere.


  Dr Archibald is also a co-ordinator of the Cambridge Centre for Climate Science, which promotes research and other activities in Climate Science going on at several Departments of the University of Cambridge (Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, Chemistry, Earth Sciences, Geography, Plant Sciences and Scott Polar Research Institute) and at the British Antarctic Survey.
