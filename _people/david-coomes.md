job_title: Conservation Research Institute Director; Head of Forest Ecology and
  Conservation Group

biography: I’m interested in biodiversity conservation and informing
  conservation policy through research. My group uses large databases of
  remotely sensed data and modern computational approaches, alongside
  traditional field approaches to address fundamental ecological questions as
  well as the most pressing ecological and biodiversity loss issues. Spaceborne
  and airborne sensors such as LiDAR, hyperspectral and multispectral sensors
  collect large amounts of data which allow us to assess the impact of land-use
  change on carbon storage and biodiversity, and to evaluate the impact of
  climate change. The use of modern computational approaches such as machine
  learning algorithms allows us to map with evermore precision species
  distributions and estimate carbon storage in various landscapes, a key factor
  in determining the potential of forests as a nature-based solution to climate
  change.
