biography: Prof Markus Kraft is a Fellow of Churchill College Cambridge and
  Professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology. He is
  the director of CARES ltd., the Singapore-Cambridge CREATE Research Centre. He
  is also a principal investigator of “Cambridge Centre for Carbon Reduction in
  Chemical Technology (C4T)”. He obtained the academic degree ‘Diplom
  Technomathematiker’ at the University of Kaiserslautern in 1992 and completed
  his Doctor rerum naturalium in Technical Chemistry at the same University in
  1997. Subsequently, he worked at the University of Karlsruhe and the
  Weierstrass Institute for Applied Analysis and Stochastics in Berlin. In 1999
  he became a lecturer in the Department of Chemical Engineering, University of
  Cambridge. He has a strong interest in the area of computational modelling and
  optimisation targeted towards developing carbon abatement and emissions
  reduction technologies for the automotive, power and chemical industries. He
  has contributed significantly towards the detailed modelling of combustion
  synthesis of organic and inorganic nanoparticles and worked on engine
  simulation, spray drying and the granulation of fine powders. More recently,
  he has been working on cyber physical systems employing time varying knowledge
  graphs with the aim to build large cross domain applications that help to
  reduce energy consumption and harmful emissions. In 2021, he was elected
  Fellow of the Alan Turing Institute.
