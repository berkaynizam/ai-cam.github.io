  I am the Robert Sansom Professor of Computer Science in the Department of
  Computer Science and Technology at the University of Cambridge and a Fellow of
  Fitzwilliam College. I am a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, ACM, and
  IEEE.


  Pronunciation: Srinivasan Keshav (Keshav is my given name, though syntactically last).


  Current work: Although I started out as a researcher in computer networking in 1988, since 2010 my focus has been on reducing the carbon footprint of energy generation, transportation, and buildings. I have recently been studying digital monitoring, reporting, and verification for trustworthy carbon credits, especially from avoided deforestation.


  Here is a more detailed list of what I am currently working on. Part II/ACS Projects: Here is a list of potential projects. I will be happy to supervise similar projects.

I hope all technologists will read it!
