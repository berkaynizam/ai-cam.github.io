biography: I am a Director of Research, equivalent to Professor, in the
  Department of Chemistry, and a researcher in the National Centre for
  Atmospheric Science (NCAS) where I am the Training Theme Leader, overseeing
  the NCAS portfolio of short courses. I work with the United Kingdom Chemistry
  and Aerosols (UKCA) community chemistry-aerosol model. This is used within the
  Met Office modelling infrastructure, and is a collaboration between the
  Universities of Cambridge, Leeds, Oxford, and the Met Office. I am interested
  in chemistry-climate interactions and Earth-system modelling, and UKCA is a
  core component of the UK Earth System Model, UKESM. Recently I have been
  working to prepare UKCA for exascale computing systems, as well as improving
  our ability to compare models with observations, and developing emulators for
  various aspects of atmospheric chemistry.
