biography: >-
  Diana’s interest in biology started as a physics undergrad studying
  topological properties of the transcriptional network in budding yeast. After
  that, she was hooked and moved to soft matter and protein self-assembly for
  her PhD, under the supervision of Dr. Charbonneau at Duke. Unsatisfied with
  addressing questions exclusively on the computational side, she embarked onto
  a hybrid postdoc in Dr. Hallatschek lab at UC Berkeley, where she studied the
  evolutionary consequences of spatial range expansion combining microbiology
  and mathematical modeling.
