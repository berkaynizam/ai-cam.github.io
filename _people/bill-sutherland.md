biography: Professor Bill Sutherland holds the Miriam Rothschild Chair of
  Conservation Biology in the Zoology Department and is a professorial Fellow in
  the College. He has written seven books and edited another five. He started as
  a birdwatcher and his main research interest has been in combining field
  observations of behaviour with theoretical models to predict the consequences
  of environmental change, such as changes in agricultural practice and climate
  change. His main current interests involve collaborating with policy makers to
  improve global conservation practice. This includes identifying environmental
  issues that have attracted insufficient attention using horizon scanning,
  collaborating with practitioners to identify the key knowledge gaps and
  establishing evidence-based conservation as a standard approach. He regularly
  provides advice to government and practitioners.
