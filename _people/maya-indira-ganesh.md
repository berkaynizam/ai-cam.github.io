  Maya Indira Ganesh is Associate Director (Research Culture & Partnerships),
  co-director of the [Narratives and Justice
  Program,](https://www.lcfi.ac.uk/research/programme/ai-narratives-and-justice) and
  a Senior Research Fellow at the Leverhulme Centre for the Future of
  Intelligence (CFI). From October 2021- July 2024 she was an assistant teaching
  professor at the [Institute of Continuing
  Education](https://www.ice.cam.ac.uk/) (ICE) where she co-directed the [MSt in
  AI Ethics and Society](https://www.lcfi.ac.uk/education/mst/) run jointly
  between ICE and CFI. Maya has masters degrees in Psychology, and in Media and
  Cultural Studies, and a Drphil in Cultural Studies. Her doctoral work took the
  case of the ‘ethics of autonomous driving’ to study the implications of
  ethical decision-making proposed by algorithmic/AI technologies for human
  social and spatial relations. Her monograph based on this work, *Auto-Correct:
  The Fantasies and Failures of AI, Ethics, and the Driverless Car* was
  published in March 2025 and can be
  ordered [here.](https://artezpress.artez.nl/books/auto-correct/) Maya draws on
  varied theoretical and methodological genres, including feminist scholarship,
  participatory methods, Media and Cultural studies, and Science and Technology
  Studies to examine how AI is being deployed in public, and how AI’s
  marginalised and expert publics shape the technology.


  Recent research projects include: with Louise Hickman and others, [AI in the Street](https://www.careful.industries/ai-in-the-street/overview) (2024); [Decision-making with AI in connected places and cities](https://ai.cam.ac.uk/projects/decision-making-with-ai-in-connected-places-and-cities), a collaboration with partners across the university supported by the AI@Cam initiative (2024-2026) and the UK government’s [AI Security Institute](https://www.aisi.gov.uk/work/strengthening-ai-resilience) (2025-2026); and [Ai for Cultural Heritage (ArCH),](https://ai.cam.ac.uk/projects/ai-for-cultural-heritage-hub-arch) (2025-2026), a collaboration being led by the University Library to ‘create a secure workspace and Community of Practice to empower non-technical users (practitioners and academics) to analyse cultural heritage data securely with AI tools.’ She is also an invited speaker, curatorial advisor, and essayist writing about cultural conditions of embodied life under automation and AI. Prior to academia, Maya spent over a decade as a researcher and info-activist working at the intersection of gender justice, security, and digital freedom of expression.  An up-to-date list of her publications, talks, and writing about AI/digital culture can be found [here](https://bodyofwork.in/).
