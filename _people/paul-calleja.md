biography: >-
  Paul Calleja is the Director of the Cambridge Open Zettascale Lab and of
  Research Computing Services at the University of Cambridge.


  Dr Calleja obtained his Ph.D. in computational bio-physics at the University of Bath. After obtaining a post-doctoral research position at Birkbeck, University of London, he moved into private industry, where he spearheaded the early commercialisation of High Performance Computing cluster solutions in the UK.


  Following six years in the commercial sector – during which time he led the market transition from proprietary SMP systems to commodity cluster-based solutions – Dr. Calleja returned to academia. At Imperial College London, Dr Calleja led the formation of a new HPC service, before moving in 2006 to the University of Cambridge to direct a major reorganisation of research computing services. This has resulted in University-wide HPC capabilities using a novel pay-per-use cloud computing model. The University of Cambridge is now home to the fastest academic supercomputer in the UK.


  Dr Calleja sits on numerous national and international HPC committees and advisory boards, as well as being a founding member of the UK HPC Special Interest Group.
