job_title: Assistant Professor
biography: I’m an Assistant Professor in the School of Psychology at the
  University of Nottingham and serve as the Open Research and Reproducibility
  Lead. My research sits at the intersection of cognitive neuroscience,
  psychology, and data science, with a particular focus on the cognitive
  neuroscience of human memory and its interactions with other cognitive systems
  and individual differences. I’m currently co-leading the OpRaise project
  (Opportunities and Potential Risks of AI in Supporting Evaluation), which
  explores the role of AI in academic assessment. I’m deeply committed to open
  and reproducible research and actively lead and support initiatives to improve
  transparency, data sharing, and research integrity—both within my institution
  and across the wider research community.
