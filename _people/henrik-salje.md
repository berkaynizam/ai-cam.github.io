biography: Henrik is a professor in the department of genetics where he heads
  the Pathogen Dynamics Group. Dr. Salje works on the spread of infectious
  diseases. He uses mathematical, computational and field research to help our
  understanding of how pathogens spread in populations, to assess control
  efforts and support policy making. This includes working with a diverse range
  of datasets including epidemiological, genomic, serological and behavioural
  data. He works closely with an established network of collaborators across
  laboratories, field-based epidemiologists, hospitals and public health
  agencies. Much of his work is in resource poor settings, especially in Asia.
  He has a particular interest in the dynamics of arboviruses such as dengue,
  Zika and chikungunya viruses.
