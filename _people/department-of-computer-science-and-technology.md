biography: I am a Associate Professor in the Computer Laboratory at the
  University of Cambridge, UK. and a Docent in Machine Learning at the Royal
  Institute of Technology, Sweden. Learning is the task of associating a new
  phenomena to previous knowledge. Knowledge is the capability of providing
  structure to the environment. In the field of machine learning we try to build
  methods that are capable of learning from data. The fundamental aspect of
  learning is assumptions, being the realisation of knowledge, the science of
  machine learning is concerned with how to formulate assumptions into
  mathematics (modelling) and how to related them to observed data (inference).
  My research focus spans both these areas, in specific I am interested in how
  we can specify data efficient and interpretable assumptions that allows us to
  learn from small amounts of data. Most of my work is focused on Bayesian
  non-parametric methods and in specific Gaussian processes.
