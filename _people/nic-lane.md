biography: I study the design, architecture and algorithms of scalable and
  robust end-to-end machine learning (ML) systems. My research interests drive
  towards the development of new forms of ML systems that are revolutionary in
  how they leverage multi-modal data (e.g., speech, vision, location, inertial
  information) to infer and reason over complex real-world situations — while
  simultaneously, maintaining extreme levels of systems flexibility (e.g.,
  distributed execution, adaptation) and efficiency (e.g., compute, memory).
