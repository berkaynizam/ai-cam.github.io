This project will develop an AI-driven energy analytics platform to help departments monitor, understand, and optimise their energy use. Using machine learning applied to gas and electricity data, the system will detect patterns, flag anomalies, and generate actionable recommendations for reducing waste and improving efficiency. A web-based dashboard will allow staff to visualise usage, benchmark performance, and model potential interventions. With high energy costs across the Department, the tool has strong potential to deliver substantial savings and carbon reductions, supporting the University’s sustainability goals and pathway to net zero.
