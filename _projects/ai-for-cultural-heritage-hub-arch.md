title: AI for Cultural Heritage Hub (ArCH)
description: Cambridge’s GLAM institutions (galleries, libraries, archives, and
  museums) house millions of objects from across the globe, representing an
  unparalleled repository of cultural and natural history. However, challenges
  such as analogue formats, handwritten records, fragmented objects,
  multilingual sources and complex surfaces make much of this data difficult to
  access.

Cambridge’s GLAM institutions (galleries, libraries, archives, and museums) house millions of objects from across the globe, representing an unparalleled repository of cultural and natural history. However, challenges such as analogue formats, handwritten records, fragmented objects, multilingual sources and complex surfaces make much of this data difficult to access.

To address these challenges, the AI for Cultural Heritage Hub (ArCH) will deploy the convening power of Cambridge’s distributed network of collections to create a secure workspace and Community of Practice to empower non-technical users (practitioners and academics) to analyse cultural heritage data securely with AI tools. By encouraging collaboration among curators, researchers, IT professionals, and AI experts, the new hub will prototype adaptive AI solutions to enhance understanding of collections and identify a selection of AI tools to address these problems.
