Managing thousands of research contracts each year, the Cambridge Research Office is developing an AI tool to analyse and compare grant funding terms across hundreds of funders. The system will deliver faster, more consistent reviews, highlight compliance risks, and support better strategic decisions. By automating routine checks, it will free staff to focus on complex negotiations and strengthen oversight of the University’s research funding portfolio.
