title: "Dr. Endo: Accelerating Endometriosis Diagnosis Through AI-Enhanced Ultrasound"
description: >
  Endometriosis affects 1 in 10 women, causing severe pain and fertility
  complications, yet diagnosis typically takes 7-10 years. Between 35-50% of
  people struggling to conceive naturally suffer from endometriosis, but
  detecting the condition requires specialist expertise and it takes
  sonographers 6-9 months to gain proficiency in identifying the five key
  sonologic signs. This project will develop an AI tool that analyses 2D
  ultrasound scans to detect subtle patterns of endometriosis, enabling earlier
  and more consistent diagnosis. The system will generate grounded outputs
  linking text descriptions to visual regions of interest, creating bounding
  boxes for features like endometriomas and adhesions. Beyond improving
  diagnosis, early detection can prevent cyst development, ease debilitating
  symptoms, avoid expensive invasive procedures like laparoscopies, and
  significantly improve IVF outcomes.
