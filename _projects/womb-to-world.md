**From conception to childhood: Revolutionising women’s health, female fertility and early infant neurodevelopment using AI**

The [From Womb to World project](https://www.wombs2world.com/) aims to develop cheaper, less invasive and more accurate AI-assisted tests that can be used throughout the conception to childhood journey. We want to improve the accuracy of early diagnosis of women’s health conditions, personalise fertility and IVF outcomes – and support the transition to parenting.

The University of Cambridge’s Departments of Psychology, Computer Science, and Physics among others will lead this project, in partnership with two leading specialty hospitals.

Dr Staci Weiss, AI-deas challenge co-lead said: “AI-deas provides an interdisciplinary platform bringing together data and new AI analytic approaches to accelerate identification of reproductive health biomarkers from embryo through to neonate.”

Mo Vali, AI-deas challenge co-lead said: “We will seek to revolutionise reproductive health technology using state-of-the-art AI methods, leveraging Cambridge’s long tradition of research in this field. Translating our research from lab to clinic by developing rigorous tests to improve clinical outcomes will benefit the wider public and help to ease the NHS burden.”
