Pelvic floor muscle dysfunction affects over 14 million people in the UK, costing the NHS more than £230 million annually. While pelvic floor training is the recommended first-line treatment, its effectiveness is limited by restricted physiotherapy access and the lack of feedback to guide correct technique. This project will transition a laboratory prototype for non-invasive pelvic floor monitoring into a population-verified tool, eliminating the need for uncomfortable internal probes. The team will expand data collection, develop next-generation algorithms that improve accuracy and ease-of-use, and conduct extensive user validation to ensure the system is reflective of community rehabilitation settings and aligned with NHS needs.
