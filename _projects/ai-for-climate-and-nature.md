The twin climate and biodiversity crises are two of the world’s most complex challenges to tackle. This project aims to develop AI approaches for bringing together a wide range of datasets and accelerating the collation of information.

This work will provide up to date, relevant and robust information for researchers and decision-makers working on climate and biodiversity conservation – opening up the possibility for more targeted and effective solutions to some of our world’s most pressing climate and biodiversity challenges. 

The [AI for Climate and Nature](https://ai.conservation.cam.ac.uk/)project is a collaboration between Cambridge Zero, Cambridge Conservation Initiative, Conservation Evidence, Institute for Computing for Climate Science, Conservation Research Institute, Centre for Landscape Regeneration, Cambridge Centre for Carbon Credits and Cambridge Centre for Earth Observation.

Anil Madhavapeddy, AI-deas challenge co-lead, said: “Mitigating the impacts of climate change while maintaining and restoring biodiversity demands urgent, evidence-based action. We’re excited to bring together an interdisciplinary team across computer science, ecology, climate and conservation to use AI to empower decision-makers to equitably tackle the biggest challenge of our generation.”

T﻿he AI for Climate and Nature team includes three different projects:

* [Harnessing AI for Forest Monitoring: Impact on Climate and Biodiversity](https://ai.conservation.cam.ac.uk/projects/harnessing-ai-for-large-scale-forest-monitoring-impact-on-climate-and-biodiversity/)
* [AI-Driven Conservation CoPilot: Revolutionising Biodiversity Solutions](https://ai.conservation.cam.ac.uk/projects/ai-driven-conservation-copilot-revolutionising-biodiversity-solutions/)
* [Calculating Optimal Land Choices for a Greener Britain](https://ai.conservation.cam.ac.uk/projects/calculating-optimal-land-choices-for-a-greener-britain/)
