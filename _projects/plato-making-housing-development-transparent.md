The UK housing crisis is characterised not only by shortage but by information asymmetry – residents lack clear, integrated information about what is being built, where, and whether schools, healthcare, and green spaces will be sufficient. This project will deliver an AI-driven platform that retrieves planning documents from Cambridgeshire councils, classifies content using a fine-tuned 120-billion-parameter model into ten policy domains, and generates evidence-backed summaries with exact source citations. The interactive map will visualise proposed developments, identify amenity gaps, and assess climate exposure, enabling both planners to confirm schemes meet guidance and residents to understand what will be built in their communities. By reducing information asymmetry and providing transparent access, PLATO aims to improve planning efficiency while strengthening public trust and engagement.
