Despite the societal and economic benefits of second language learning, participation in language education has been declining, with marked inequalities in provision across educational settings. This project will deliver an AI-based training tool that provides personalised feedback to enhance language education. Building on research with over 200 adolescent learners that mapped cognitive and environmental predictors of language proficiency, the system will assess each learner’s phonological working memory, awareness, and aptitude to generate personalised training pathways. A compact language model will provide tailored feedback ranging from articulatory guidance to perceptual cues, adjusting practice intensity based on learner strengths. Beyond enhancing outcomes, the tool promises to make language learning more accessible and inclusive across diverse educational contexts.
