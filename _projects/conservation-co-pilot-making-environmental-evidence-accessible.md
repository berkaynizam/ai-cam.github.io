title: "Conservation Co-pilot: Making Environmental Evidence Accessible"
description: >
  With over 1 million users already accessing the Conservation Evidence
  database, this project will develop the first ‘Conservation Co-pilot’ – an
  AI-powered chat interface that retrieves, summarises, and presents
  conservation evidence to answer user questions. The challenge is ensuring that
  AI faithfully represents scientific evidence without misrepresentation.
  Building on rigorous evaluation research comparing frontier AI models with
  human experts, the team will create an agentic system that draws together
  evidence while maintaining faithfulness to source material. The tool will be
  game-changing for conservation decision-makers seeking evidence to guide
  action.
