  Local government staff will have the chance to find academic partners who can
  help them use AI to tackle their biggest operational challenges at a new event
  this November.


  ai@cam’s new AI in local government fair, held on the 24th November, flips the traditional conference model: instead of researchers presenting their work, council staff will present their biggest operational challenges and ideas for how AI might help address them.


  As councils increasingly look to artificial intelligence to improve services and meet rising demand, the AI in local government fair will connect the frontline knowledge of local authorities with Cambridge’s research expertise. By spotlighting real pressures faced by councils – from social care paperwork to planning backlogs and transport congestion – the fair creates a two-way marketplace, designed to explore how AI could provide practical solutions.

apply_text: >-
  The AI in local government fair brings together council staff from across
  Cambridgeshire, Peterborough, and Greater Manchester with University of
  Cambridge AI researchers. Local government teams will showcase posters
  outlining challenges where AI could make a difference - from streamlining
  social care documentation to optimising transport routes to processing
  planning applications.


  Researchers will browse the challenge presentations in a “reverse” poster session, leading to informal discussions and potential collaborations. Promising collaborations from the poster session will then be eligible for ai@cam’s AI for Local Government Accelerator funding programme, launching later this year to support proof-of-concept development.


  The AI in local government fair creates a two-way marketplace: council staff will showcase challenge posters outlining where AI could make a difference, while University researchers will provide profiles of their expertise and research interests via the event registration process. This dual approach ensures council staff can identify researchers with relevant capabilities, while researchers can spot challenges that align with their technical skills and research goals.


  **W﻿ant to apply?**


  The AI in Local Government Challenge Fair takes place on **Monday 24 November 2025, from 12.00-16.00**


  Council staff and University of Cambridge researchers interested in participating will need to apply before **17:00 on Friday 14 November.**


  I﻿f you have any further questions, please contact Jess Montgomery (jkm40@cam.ac.uk)

faq_title: F.A.Q.
faqs:
  - question: What makes this a "reverse" poster session?
    answer: Unlike traditional academic conferences where researchers present their
      work, council staff will present their operational challenges and ideas
      for AI solutions. University researchers will browse these challenge
      presentations to find collaboration opportunities.
  - question: What types of challenges should councils present?
    answer: Any public service challenge where AI might help - from reducing social
      care paperwork and processing planning applications to optimising
      transport routes and improving customer services. We’re particularly
      interested in challenges that could benefit multiple councils if solved.
  - question: Who can attend?
    answer: Local council staff from Cambridgeshire, Peterborough, and Greater
      Manchester, plus University of Cambridge researchers with AI expertise.
      Council staff don’t need technical AI knowledge - domain expertise in
      public services is what we’re looking for.
  - answer: University - council partnerships will be eligible for dedicated funding
      in our second phase to develop proof-of-concept solutions. We’ll provide
      structured follow-up to help promising collaborations move forward.
    question: What happens if I find a potential collaborator?
  - answer: Not at all. We want people who understand the real operational
      challenges councils face.
    question: Do I need to be technical to participate as a council staff member?
  - answer: |-
      * The specific challenge you’re facing
      * Why current approaches aren’t working
      * Your ideas (even rough ones) for how AI might help
      * The potential impact if this problem were solved
      * Any relevant data or context about scale
    question: What should my poster include?
  - answer: 4 hours (12:00-16:00) including lunch and refreshments. This gives time
      for meaningful conversations rather than rushed presentations.
    question: How long is the poster session?
  - answer: Later this year, ai@cam will be launching its AI for Local Government
      Accelerator, which will invite applications for funding and
      incubator-style support for collaborative projects between the University
      and local government.
    question: What happens after the session?
  - answer: While we welcome poster presentations from all participating councils,
      we anticipate that our AI for Local Government Accelerator funding
      programme will be held by University of Cambridge researchers. However,
      solutions developed could potentially benefit councils across all
      participating regions, and we anticipate that all funding proposals should
      include at least one council partner. Full guidance on this will be
      published after the poster session.
    question: Who will be eligible for follow up funding?
  - answer: The session itself provides valuable networking and learning
      opportunities. Many councils find that discussing their challenges with
      researchers generates new insights even without formal collaboration.
    question: What if my idea doesn't lead to a collaboration?
  - answer: If you’re dealing with large volumes of data, repetitive tasks, pattern
      recognition needs, or complex decision support - AI might help.
    question: How do I know if my challenge is suitable for AI?
  - answer: Absolutely. We encourage this where it makes sense - shared challenges
      often lead to more impactful and sustainable solutions.
    question: Can multiple councils work on the same challenge?
  - answer: >-
      Create your poster in A0 portrait format (841mm x 1189mm) using software
      like PowerPoint, Canva, or Google Slides. We can print it for you if you
      email the PDF to contact@ai.cam.ac.uk by 17:00 on Friday 14 November, or
      you can arrange your own printing (allow 2-3 working days).


      For effective posters: use a clear, bold title; organise content logically with digestible sections; stick to 2-3 complementary colours and clean fonts; include visuals like charts or diagrams; use bullet points and avoid jargon; and include your contact details.
    question: How do I create the poster?
