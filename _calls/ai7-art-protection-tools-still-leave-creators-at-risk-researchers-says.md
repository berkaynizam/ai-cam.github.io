  ## Supporting administrative innovation across the University


  ai@cam is launching a new initiative to support administrative staff across the University to use AI to enhance University operations.


  The “AI for University Ops” programme will provide funding, technical support, and community building to help administrative teams implement AI solutions that address their operational challenges.


  The programme will offer technical support and micro-grants for promising administrative AI projects, while also documenting existing successful use cases and creating a community of practice that helps scale successful applications.

  Professional services teams from across the University are invited to submit
  expressions of interest in engaging with this initiative by 09:00, Wednesday
  28 May 2025. This initial phase will help identify existing AI implementations
  and gather input on administrative challenges that could benefit from AI
  solutions.


  A launch workshop will follow on the 12 June, bringing together participants to share examples, develop collaborations, and network with colleagues facing similar challenges.


  If you would like to express interest in this initiative, please complete the form below by 09:00 on 28 May 2025.


  We will be holding an information and Q&A session on 2 May, 11:00 - 12:00, please sign up here for the Zoom link.


  For further information, please review the FAQs below.

faq_title: F.A.Q.
faqs:
  - question: What is AI for the University Ops?
    answer: The “AI for University Ops” programme provides a lightweight, integrated
      approach to supporting administrative AI adoption across the University.
      Building on our successful approach to enabling AI adoption in research,
      this programme will provide support for promising AI projects in
      administration, create opportunities to share successful practices, and
      build a community of practitioners.
  - question: How does the programme work?
    answer: >-
      The programme operates in three phases:


      * Phase 1: Kick-off: We’re launching an Expression of Interest that invites PSS staff to suggest projects or applications they would be interested in developing and begins to log existing use cases.

      * Phase 2: Project proposals: On 12 June we’ll host a launch workshop that invites participants in the EOI to share example use cases, develop collaborations, and network. This will be followed by a call for projects that invites proposals for further work.

      * Phase 3: Implementation: Selected projects receive support and engage in community building activities.
  - question: How much funding is available per project?
    answer: This EOI is not an application for funding, though we anticipate that
      funding might be a component of the call for projects that follows. We’ll
      develop the specifics of our support offer based on feedback from our EOI.
      Our starting point is that we might offer small grants up to £10,000,
      depending on scope and potential impact. These grants are intended to
      cover implementation costs, such as potential software subscriptions or
      resource for data collection. They are not intended to cover staff time.
  - answer: The programme is open to professional services and technical staff
      across all university departments. This first phase invites EOIs from all
      University staff with an interest in applying AI for University
      operations. In the next phase of work, we anticipate that project
      applications can come from individuals or teams; the lead should be a
      member of the Professional Services Staff.
    question: Who can engage with the EOI?
  - answer: We encourage you to share your existing implementations through the
      Expression of Interest form. This helps build our knowledge repository.
      Existing implementers may also be able to apply for funding to expand or
      enhance their current solutions.
    question: What if we are already using AI tools in our department?
  - answer: No prior AI expertise is necessary, but a willingness to be proactive in
      learning how to implement these technologies is vital. The programme will
      provide technical support through Accelerate Science’s AI Clinic. The
      ideal applicant has a clear administrative challenge and willingness to
      learn, rather than existing technical skills.
    question: What technical expertise is required?
  - answer: At this stage of the programme, we are inviting expressions of interest
      in developing project ideas. When we are looking for projects or inviting
      applications for project support, we expect that each implementation
      should include consideration of ethical implications, particularly for
      projects handling sensitive data. We want to embed responsible AI
      principles in the use of AI in the University. The programme will
      encourage critical reflection on the use of AI as projects progress.
    question: How will ethical concerns be addressed?
  - answer: Successful implementations will be documented and shared through the
      digital hub and showcase event. A key aim of successful projects should be
      the mainstreaming of their AI tools.
    question: What happens after the funding period?
  - answer: When we invite project proposals, we will ask projects to define their
      success metrics as part of the application process. These might include
      time saved, error reduction, satisfaction ratings, or other quantifiable
      benefits. The programme’s overall success will be measured by number of
      implementations, cross-departmental adoption, and documented efficiency
      gains.
    question: How will success be measured?
  - answer: Please fill in the expression of interest
      form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfBFooODF_Ifbl2LUiXvyFMeAP1tqGf7qFk06qbO0ZIEuqKCw/viewform?usp=sharing) by
      09:00, 28 May 2025. You will need to be logged in to your @cam.ac.uk
      account to access the form.
    question: How can I apply?
  - answer: Please contact Annabelle Scott, ai@cam Programme Manager
      (as599@cam.ac.uk). We will be holding an information and Q&A session on 2
      May from 11:00 - 12:00, please sign
      up [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfnuRmYWlfHhAffBXt9cFWLWAUFzoIhzj_xx74tZiI-VhsBYA/viewform?usp=header) for
      the Zoom link.
