  ai@cam announces its second AI Sciencepreneurship Bootcamp, an immersive
  two-day programme that helps researchers translate AI for science ideas to
  practice through entrepreneurship.


  Following the success of our first event in June 2025, ai@cam is launching the second edition of its AI Sciencepreneurship Bootcamp, an intensive two-day programme designed to help researchers transform breakthrough AI innovations in scientific research into real-world impact.


  Running from 11-12 February 2026, this hands-on bootcamp will combine technical expertise in scientific applications of AI with entrepreneurial insights from Cambridge’s innovation ecosystem, supporting the next generation of science-based ventures.


  Cambridge is home to over 5,500 knowledge-intensive businesses and the world’s highest concentration of academic entrepreneurs. AI could help supercharge scientific discovery and innovation, driving a new wave of breakthroughs in areas from healthcare, to genomics, to sustainable energy. However, researchers looking to translate their scientific AI innovations face challenges, from designing AI tools tailored for specific scientific domains to building product-ready solutions from laboratory innovations.


  Our first bootcamp saw teams develop innovative ventures including Nature Network, an AI mapping tool to connect the public with the natural world; Ötzi, an AI-driven climate-risk modelling tool for insurance markets; and From Womb to World, an AI-powered digital health tool for IVF and high-risk pregnancies. Building on this momentum, this second edition will provide an enhanced pathway for researchers to develop their scientific AI innovations into viable ventures.

faqs:
  - question: Who can participate in the bootcamp?
    answer: >-
      The bootcamp is open to PhD students, postdocs, and early-career
      researchers  at the University of Cambridge and its associated research
      institutions, working on AI applications in scientific domains such as
      biology, chemistry, physics, environmental science, healthcare, and
      related fields. Participants should have an understanding of core methods
      and concepts in AI and an idea for a project they’d like to develop. 


      As part of registration for the session, we will ask participants to agree to a confidentiality undertaking, to allow other participants in the workshop to share their ideas during discussions.
  - question: What level of AI expertise is required to join?
    answer: "**Participants** should have foundational knowledge of AI methods and
      concepts. Those looking to build these skills can access preparatory
      courses through Accelerate Science’s training programmes before applying.
      We find participants gain most from this workshop when they have an idea
      for an AI for science project that they would like to develop or are
      already working on."
  - question: How can I apply?
    answer: >-
      Registration is now open and you can apply here. The deadline for
      applications is 17:00 on Wednesday 28 January 2026.


      The registration asks for:


      * Your research background

      * Your AI experience and expertise

      * A description of the idea you want to develop

      * Your motivation for joining the bootcamp

      * We have a limited number of spaces at the workshop, so encourage early registration. Teams working on shared challenges are welcome to apply, but we ask that each team member must submit an individual application.
