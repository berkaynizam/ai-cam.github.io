  Universities face growing administrative complexity while working to support
  their core academic mission. AI offers a capacity-building tool to support
  more efficient administrative processes while freeing up time for complex work
  requiring judgment, creativity, and human collaboration. ai@cam’s AI for
  Operations programme aims to support this shift, enabling improved student and
  researcher experiences through streamlined and responsive administrative
  systems.


  Our previous call for expressions of interest in AI for Operations showed there is huge interest from professional services staff in experimenting with AI across diverse applications - from communications teams using AI for content generation to finance departments exploring contract analysis. Many staff want to upskill in this area, but lack the resources to identify and implement AI tools that could benefit their work. In response, ai@cam is launching the AI for Operations project funding call. This initiative will provide funding and technical support for administrative teams ready to deploy AI solutions that address real operational challenges.


  Projects supported by this call will receive up to £10,000 to carry out 6 month project sprints, during which time teams will have access to technical support via an AI Clinic, and community engagement activities to develop shared case studies and best practices. Showcase events will share project outcomes with the wider community.

faq_title: F.A.Q.
faqs:
  - question: What are the objectives of the AI for operations programme?
    answer: The AI for Operations programme enables professional services teams to
      deploy AI in specific projects or workflows that improves the efficiency
      of University operational processes, and develops a network where
      successful practices can be shared.
  - question: Who is eligible to apply?
    answer: Professional services staff teams employed by the University of
      Cambridge are eligible to apply for this funding. Academic and
      academic-related staff are also eligible to apply, however, we expect all
      teams to include professional services staff.
  - question: What information is required in the application form?
    answer: >-
      The application form will ask you to provide the following information:


      * Names, CRSID, department and job title of all team members

      * Project summary and description of how this project will improve University operational and business needs

      * Cross-departmental potential

      * Leadership support

      * Project support needs

      * Approach to risk management and ethical considerations

      * Budget summary

      * Timeline to complete project within the time frame allocated

      * Line manager details

      * Agreement to collaborate with ai@cam on communications activities related to the project
  - answer: |-
      The project proposal will be evaluated based on the following criteria: 

      * Business need
      * Impact on operational processes
      * Achievable delivery within the allocated time frame
      * Approach to risk management and ethical considerations
    question: How will the project proposal be evaluated?
  - answer: Small grants of up to £10,000 will be available, depending on scope and
      potential impact of each project. These grants are intended to cover
      implementation costs, such as potential software subscriptions or
      resources for data collection. They are not intended to cover staff time.
    question: How much funding is available per project?
  - answer: >-
      **Funding:** Grants of up to £10,000 each will be awarded to project teams
      to cover implementation costs such as software subscriptions and resources
      for data collection (not staff time).


      **Technical support:** Monthly drop-in AI clinic sessions will be arranged with Accelerate Science Machine Learning Engineers who will provide hands-on guidance throughout your project.


      **Community:** Opportunities to collaborate with other project teams through peer learning roundtables will be organised. An AI Community of Practice will act as a digital hub for documentation on existing case studies. 


      **Showcase:** Project teams will present their successful implementations to the wider University community and contribute to building institutional knowledge.
    question: What support will grant awardees recieve?
  - answer: We will notify candidates in the week commencing 6 October if their
      project has been selected for funding.
    question: When will I find out if my project has been awarded funding?
  - answer: Yes. If you are awarded funding we expect your line manager to give
      their support for you to undertake the project proposed.
    question: Do I need approval from my line manager?
  - answer: No prior AI expertise is necessary, but a willingness to be proactive in
      learning how to implement these technologies is vital. The programme will
      provide technical support through Accelerate Science’s AI Clinic. The
      ideal applicant has a clear administrative challenge and willingness to
      learn, rather than existing technical skills.
    question: What technical expertise is required?
  - answer: This depends on your project’s scope and team size. Project members are
      expected to attend our launch workshop on 7 October 2025 and a showcase
      event at the project’s conclusion. All projects will need to be completed
      within 6 months of the project start date.
    question: What would the time commitment be for conducting a project?
  - answer: Yes, please provide a brief summary in the application form of what you
      would like to use the funding for. Projects need to be completed within a
      6 month time period.
    question: Do we need to submit a costings breakdown?
  - answer: We encourage you to create cross-disciplinary teams, they can be made up
      of staff from different departments. We recommend that teams have no more
      than 10 members of staff.
    question: Are there any restrictions on the team makeup, for example are there a
      maximum number of staff that can be in a team, can it be made up of staff
      from multiple departments?
  - answer: >-
      Projects can cover any professional services function that could benefit
      from AI augmentation. Our  previous expressions of interest in this area
      have already flagged potential applications of AI in the following areas:


      * Processing information from forms and databases;

      * Content preparation;

      * Timetabling and room booking;

      * Recruitment process optimisation;

      * Coding assistance and programming for data analysis;

      * Managing postgraduate admissions correspondence;

      * Streamlining document processing;

      * Routine administration e.g. note-taking.
    question: What kind of administrative challenges are covered under the scope of
      the funding?
  - answer: We will ask successful projects to share their implementations in a
      showcase event and document their processes and findings to be shared to
      the wider community.
    question: What happens after the funding period?
  - answer: >-
      Each project must consider risks and ethical implications, particularly
      when handling sensitive data. We’re committed to embedding responsible AI
      principles throughout the University, and the programme will encourage
      ongoing critical reflection as projects develop. Current university
      guidance on AI in relation to information compliance, communications, and
      education can be found here:
