  New funding scheme supports collaborative research projects between University
  of Cambridge and local authorities.


  The University of Cambridge is launching a new funding scheme to support collaborative AI research and development projects with local government partners. The ai@cam Local Government AI Accelerator will provide grants of up to £25,000 for proof-of-concept projects that address shared challenges across multiple councils.


  The fund represents a new approach to AI innovation in public services, connecting academic expertise with real-world operational needs. Projects must demonstrate clear buy-in from at least one local authority partner, be led by a University of Cambridge researcher eligible to hold funding, and deliver results within 12 months.


  The initiative builds on ai@cam’s work with local government partners across Cambridgeshire and beyond. Early AI adopters in local government are already demonstrating the technology’s potential in areas like social care, planning consultation analysis, and infrastructure maintenance. This collaboration aims to support councils in identifying promising AI applications and developing appropriate solutions.

  Funded projects will receive up to £25,000 for 9-12 months of proof-of-concept
  development, with ongoing support through monthly community of practice
  sessions and technical support clinics with ai@cam’s machine learning
  engineers. A final showcase will document lessons learned and explore pathways
  for scaling successful solutions across the sector.


  Proposals must be submitted by 16.00 on Friday 13 February and should demonstrate clear partnership with at least one local authority.


  To apply, we ask for some basic project information, a two page project proposal, and supporting documents to demonstrate local authority support and headline spending plans.


  **Information session**

  We will also be hosting an upcoming Q&A information session about the funding scheme on **10:00 - 11:00,** **Thursday 15 January.** You can [register for this session here](https://cam-ac-uk.zoom.us/meeting/register/SRLizoXXSIKVHMrruc7H6g)

faq_title: F.A.Q.
faqs:
  - question: What is the ai@cam Local Government Innovation Fund?
    answer: The fund provides grants of up to £25,000 to support collaborative
      research projects between University of Cambridge researchers and local
      government partners. It aims to develop proof-of-concept AI solutions that
      address challenges in public service delivery in local authorities.
  - question: Who can apply for funding?
    answer: >-
      Applications must be led by a researcher based at the University of
      Cambridge and demonstrate clear buy-in from at least one local authority
      partner. We encourage applications that address challenges shared across
      multiple councils, as these have greater potential for sector-wide impact.


      We have already heard from some local authority partners about areas where they would welcome support during a workshop on 24 November 2025. You can read more about these areas on our recent ai@cam blog.
  - question: What level of council involvement is required?
    answer: Projects must have engagement with local authority partners throughout
      development, not just at the application stage. This means ongoing
      engagement with council staff who understand the operational context and
      can help ensure the solutions being developed address real needs.
  - answer: >-
      We’re looking for proof-of-concept AI projects that address real-world
      challenges in local government. The call will not restrict topic areas
      (but you can read about areas that councils have already flagged as being
      of interest in our recent ai@cam blog.)


      All projects must demonstrate clear public benefit potential. This might include:


      * AI tools and applications: AI capabilities to support specific service delivery challenges (for example, document processing, data analysis, prediction models).

      * Infrastructure and standards development: Frameworks, protocols, or integration layers that enable AI deployment across fragmented systems. This might include data sharing standards, orchestration platforms, or API specifications that allow different systems to work together.

      * Process redesign with AI enablement: Rethinking service delivery processes where AI is one component of a broader improvement. For example, simplifying a complex application process while using AI to support specific steps.
    question: What types of projects will be funded?
  - question: How much funding is available?
    answer: Individual projects can receive up to £25,000 for 6-12 months of
      proof-of-concept development. Additional support including technical
      clinics, monthly community of practice sessions, and programme management
      is provided by ai@cam.
  - answer: Funded projects must deliver within 12 months of receiving funding. This
      includes proof-of-concept development, testing with council partners,
      documentation of lessons learned, and presentation at the final showcase
      event. The timeline ensures solutions remain relevant to current council
      needs and maintains momentum for potential scaling.
    question: What is the project timeline?
  - answer: >-
      Proposals will be reviewed to consider their:


      * Public benefit potential: Does this address a need that will improve people’s lives? Does the approach align with public expectations from our dialogue work, particularly regarding human oversight, transparency, and accessibility

      * Technical feasibility: Can this be delivered within 9-12 months? Does the team have the right expertise? Are there insurmountable technical or governance barriers?

      * Strength of council partnerships: Is there collaboration with committed capacity? Can the team access real operational contexts for testing?
        Delivery capability within 12 months; and 
      * Potential for scalability across multiple authorities: Could this work for multiple authorities? What would it take to adapt or adopt elsewhere? 

      * Learning value: Will this generate useful insights even if the AI approach doesn’t work? Does the team have an idea about how to evaluate their impact?
        Selection criteria are informed by public dialogues carried out by ai@cam in autumn 2025. You can read more about those dialogues in this ai@cam report.
    question: How will projects be selected?
  - answer: >-
      Beyond financial support, funded projects will receive: monthly community
      of practice sessions to share progress and lessons learned with other
      funded teams; technical support clinics offering advice from ai@cam’s
      machine learning engineers; and focused workshops on shared challenges.


      Alongside these project-specific activities, ai@cam will continue to convene networking sessions across councils to support sharing of lessons learned and successful solutions.
    question: What support will funded projects recieve?
  - answer: We strongly encourage projects to adopt open-source licensing (BSD) to
      enable sector-wide adoption and sustainable scaling. This ensures that
      successful solutions can be adapted and implemented by other local
      authorities without costly licensing barriers, maximising the public
      benefit of the investment. However, we also understand there may be times
      when commercial considerations require other approaches.
    question: Will projects need to be open source?
  - answer: We strongly encourage applications that address challenges shared across
      multiple councils. Projects involving multiple authorities should set out
      how each partner will contribute and benefit.
    question: Can projects involve multiple councils?
  - answer: While the programme builds on ai@cam’s existing relationships with
      Cambridgeshire councils, applications involving local authorities from
      other regions are welcome. The key eligibility requirements are active
      partnership with at least one council and a Cambridge-based researcher who
      is eligible to hold funding on behalf of the University. Strong
      applications that address challenges relevant across multiple authorities
      will be competitive regardless of geographic location.
    question: What if my council isn't in Cambridgeshire?
  - answer: >-
      Applications consist of a Google Form (covering basic team and partner
      details), a two-page project description, and supporting documents.


      Your two-page description should cover: 


      * The operational challenge you’re addressing and why it matters: What problem are you addressing and why does it matter? Who is affected? Is this challenge shared across multiple authorities? 

      * Your proposed AI approach and why it’s appropriate: How will you address this challenge? If AI is part of the solution, why is it the right tool for this problem? If you’re developing infrastructure or redesigning processes, how does this enable better outcomes?

      * Your council partnership and how you’ll work together: Who is your council partner contact? How will you access real operational contexts for testing? What pathway exists for implementation if successful?

      * Your delivery plan and team expertise: What will you deliver in 12 months? Who is on your team and what relevant experience do they bring? What are the key milestones and risks?

      * Potential for scaling across multiple authorities: What would it take for other authorities to adopt this?; and 

      * How you’ll address ethical considerations, including how the project aligns with the concerns expressed in ai@cam’s public dialogues.

      * You’ll also need to attach: a letter of support from your local authority partner to confirm their willingness to collaborate, and a budget breakdown showing how you’ll use the funding (up to £25,000). We don’t need detailed budgets at this time, but we are looking for headlines on breakdown of spend. 


      The Google Form requests the following basic project information:


      * Project title

      * Lead applicant (PI) name, department, email

      * Co-investigators (if any)

      * Local authority partner(s) name(s)
