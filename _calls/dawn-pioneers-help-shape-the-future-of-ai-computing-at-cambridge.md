  ## Shaping the future of AI computing at Cambridge


  The Dawn system will significantly expand Cambridge’s compute capabilities, supercharging AI and simulation research across the University. With five times the performance of Cambridge’s previous GPU system, it is designed to meet the needs of researchers who require high performance computing for AI, with implications for our ability to use AI for research across climate science, astronomy, healthcare, and more.


  To translate this capability into tools and applications that deliver real-world benefits, the system needs to be accessible to a wide range of research users across the AI and simulation communities. We’re inviting a cohort of pioneer projects with High Performance Computing needs to have early access to the Dawn system and help shape how researchers interact with this powerful new resource.




  ## Early access to transformative computing capabilities


  We’re inviting researchers across the University of Cambridge to submit applications by 17:00 on 8 January 2024. Pioneer projects will receive:


  * Early access to the Dawn supercomputer \* Research software engineering support \* Input into the design of system interfaces and workflows * Access to the Accelerate Science Machine Learning Engineering Clinic


  For further information, please read the FAQs below or join our Q&A session on 18 December from 16:00 – 17:00 (register at [this link](https://cam-ac-uk.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZAoc-mqpzwtHNTV2n5hLJ2J3r3cxx3E3-Ci)).

faqs:
  - answer: This new compute resource will support AI and simulation research across
      the UK and the University of Cambridge. To make sure researchers across
      the community can capitalise on the benefits Dawn offers, we will need
      well-designed interfaces and working processes that make the system easy
      to use and understand. We hope that working with this cohort of pioneer
      projects will help us tailor our ways of working to the needs of the AI
      and simulation communities.
    question: Why have you launched this call?
  - answer: Applications are open to any postgraduate student or member of staff at
      the University of Cambridge, working in any discipline, including natural,
      physical, social, medical, and computer sciences, arts, humanities, and
      engineering.
    question: Who can apply?
  - answer: Dawn is being designed to support converged AI and simulation workloads.
      To help us understand different types of stakeholder needs, we’re looking
      to engage with a variety of pioneer projects in the AI and simulation
      communities. You might already have extensive experience of engaging with
      high performance computing facilities, or none at all. You might be
      working on simulations specifically, or broader applications of AI.
    question: What kind of projects will be suppported?
  - answer: In addition to early access to the Dawn system, we’re offering pioneer
      participants support in the form of research software engineering advice,
      and access to services such as the Accelerate Science Machine Learning
      Engineering Clinic. This first cohort of projects will be able to access
      the Dawn system free of charge.
    question: What support will I get?
  - answer: The Dawn system provides 256 Dell XE9640 servers nodes, each with 4
      Intel Data Centre Max 1550 GPUs (128 GB HBM RAM per GPU). Each server has
      2 Gen 5 XEONs, 1TB RAM and 4 HDR200 Infiniband links. The system uses
      Intel GPUs, so applications need to use oneAPI or standard AI libraries
      ported to Intel GPUs.
    question: What are the capabilities of the dawn systems?
  - answer: The Dawn system will be coming online in January 2024, and we anticipate
      working with projects to set them up with the service in the first half of
      2024.
    question: Over what timescales will pioneer projects operate?
  - answer: >-
      The application requires:


      1. Name 2. Department 3. Project title 4. Project summary (max. 1000 characters) 5. Summary of compute needs (max. 1500 characters) 6. Level of familiarity with high performance compute systems (max. 1000 characters) 7. Type of support needed (max. 1000 characters) 8. Readiness/timescale for deployment (max. 1000 characters)
    question: What information is required for the application?
  - answer: To apply, please submit an application form at
      https://forms.gle/futP2GvjWmnKLaFS9 by 17:00 on Monday 8 January 2024.
