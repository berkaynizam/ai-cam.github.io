  ## AI innovation for education and cultural heritage


  AI is shaping how we preserve, access, and share our cultural and scientific knowledge. From decoding ancient texts to shaping how students learn in the classroom, advances in AI offer opportunities across the education and cultural heritage sectors. This funding call is an opportunity to develop AI that connects AI development to our rights to education, cultural life, and access to science.


  Activities could include engagement with underrepresented communities to understand how AI could serve their needs; co-design or prototyping of AI tools with practitioners in the education and cultural heritage sectors; or research to create AI systems that can meet the needs of those working in these sectors. All ideas must have their roots in interdisciplinary research that addresses real world needs.




  ## Challenge-led research that delivers real-world benefits


  We’re inviting researchers across the University of Cambridge to submit expressions of interest by 17:00 on 7 October 2024. A total of £150,000 will be available to supported projects.


  After submitting expressions of interest, researchers will be invited to a workshop in the autumn term to share ideas and build collaborations. Full proposals will be invited following the workshop with successful projects announced in December 2024.


  For further information, please read the FAQs below or join our information and Q&A session on 19 September, from 14:00 – 15:00 (register to receive Zoom details at [this link](https://cam-ac-uk.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZIpd-msrDovHdQZhJ3nS0O69N-m18PGBKLZ)).

  - answer: ai@cam is the University of Cambridge’s new flagship mission to create
      AI technologies that serve science, citizens, and society. You can find
      out more about our work at https://ai.cam.ac.uk
    question: What is AI@cam
  - answer: The Accelerate Programme for Scientific Discovery is an initiative
      funded by Schmidt Sciences to advance the use of AI for scientific
      discovery at the University of Cambridge. By combining research, training,
      and engagement activities, the Accelerate Programme aims to drive a step
      change in the use of AI for science across the University of Cambridge.
      You can find out more at https://science.ai.cam.ac.uk/
    question: What is the accelerate programme for scientific discovery?
  - answer: Last year, we launched our AI-deas initiative as an incubator for
      interdisciplinary research. This awarded funding to five challenge-led
      research programmes. Working with the Accelerate Programme for Scientific
      Discovery, we are now able to fund a further programme in the education
      and cultural heritage sectors.
    question: Why have you launched this call?
  - question: Who can apply?
    answer: This call is open to staff at the University of Cambridge, working in
      any discipline, including natural, physical, biological, social, medical,
      and computer sciences, arts, humanities, and engineering, and the
      University’s collections community. PhD students can submit ideas, but
      please get permission from your supervisor first.
  - answer: >-
      Today, we’re launching the first of a two-step process. We’re inviting
      expressions of interest with ideas for research that can addresses issues
      in educational and cultural heritage, and that helps advance ai@cam’s
      mission to create AI that serves science, citizens, and society. We are
      also seeking your input on how we can best support research through this
      call.


      The second step of this process will convene the community of researchers with shared interests in education and cultural heritage to help develop these ideas. The reason for working in two phases like this is to encourage collaboration: we know there is interest in AI from across the University, and world-leading expertise across departments, but it isn’t always easy to find collaborators, and we hope to facilitate this process.


      Full proposals will be invited following the workshop and we aim to announce successful projects in December 2024. The timeline for grants funded through this call will be confirmed, with all grants ending by 30 April 2026.
    question: How will the process work?
  - answer: While this first stage of expressions of interest is focused on the
      research community within the University (including its museums and
      collections), we hope the resulting challenges will engage with external
      partners both in the UK and beyond. We’re particularly interested in
      engaging with communities affected by the development of AI and user
      groups with an interest in the design of AI systems.
    question: I am not a researcher at the University of Cambridge. Can I get involved?
  - answer: We have £150k to allocate to this call. Before deciding how to package
      these funds – for example, as small grants or a single challenge – we want
      to better understand the interests and needs of the Cambridge community.
      The application form seeks your view on this. We will provide further
      information to those who have expressed interest in the scheme in the
      autumn including details of a workshop to support teams in sharing their
      ideas and developing collaborations.
    question: What kind of funding do you expect to offer?
  - answer: >-
      Funding will be deployable flexibly depending on the needs of the project.
      The amount of funding support available for projects will be confirmed at
      full proposal stage based on input from this EOI.


      We will ask funding recipients to work with members of the ai@cam team to develop their projects, with a tailored support package from our interdisciplinary research incubator programme. We anticipate working with challenges developed in this round up to 30 April 2026, and for funds to be deployed over this period. There may also be times where we ask funding recipients to contribute to ai@cam and Accelerate Programme events and comms activities.
    question: What are the terms and conditions of funding?
  - answer: Please fill in the [application
      form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScuuHi0SR6Mfwmzf2BGexUKwfF9txcL10qUmR2DLdlw-P0g7Q/viewform?usp=sf_link) by
      17:00, 7 October 2024. You will need to be logged in to your @cam.ac.uk
      account to access the form.
    question: How can I apply?
  - answer: >-
      At this stage, we are looking for some details on your idea for using AI
      in the education and cultural heritage sectors, alongside some details
      about you. We are also asking for your views on how we can best support
      research through this call in terms of project scale and training and
      resources from our research incubator.


      For further questions please contact [accelerate-science@cst.cam.ac.uk](mailto:accelerate-science@cst.cam.ac.uk). We will be holding an information and Q & A session on 19 September from 14:00 - 15:00, please sign up [here](https://cam-ac-uk.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZIpd-msrDovHdQZhJ3nS0O69N-m18PGBKLZ) for the Zoom link.
