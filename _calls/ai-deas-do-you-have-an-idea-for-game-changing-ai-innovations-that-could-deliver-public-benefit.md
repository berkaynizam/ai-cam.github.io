  ## AI innovation in the service of science-citizens, and society


  Connecting AI development to public value is more important than ever. ai@cam will drive a new wave of challenge-led innovation, tackling the implementation gap between our aspirations for AI and our ability to deploy it to tackle major societal challenges. We want to generate new thinking about the role of AI in addressing major challenges, build coalitions in areas of need, and create partnerships to take research from lab to real-world benefit.


  An ambitious, multidisciplinary programme of challenge-led, AI-enabled innovation supported by ai@cam will spin up new research teams, develop collaborations with business, policymakers and civil society, and take innovative ideas from the lab to application. Research teams supported by AI@Cam’s AI-deas scheme will have access to funding and research support to scale their work and impact.




  ## Challenge-led research that delivers real-world benefits


  To start, we’re inviting researchers across the University of Cambridge to submit concept papers setting out their idea for how AI could serve science, citizens, and society at this [link](https://forms.gle/e6jBHyUdbZ3wBV2f7) by 09:00 on 6 October 2023.


  We’ll convene researchers working on connected themes together to establish a challenge-led research programme that can drive a step-change in AI research, policy, and practice, and we’ll work with you to develop this programme.


  We’ll provide start-up funding of £150k, and we’ll work with challenge teams to support your progress. If we have a large number of high-quality challenges proposed, there’ll be a selection stage where we identify which proposals receive funding in years one and two of our work. For further information, please read the FAQs below.


  For further information, please read the FAQs below or join our drop-in session on 19 September, from 13:00 – 14:00 (register to receive Zoom details at [this link](https://cl-cam-ac-uk.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJEkf--upzsvE9PLQUPgSZCGjBlO_dl-0szF)).

  - answer: ai@cam is the University of Cambridge’s new flagship mission to create
      AI technologies that serve science, citizens, and society. We’ll be
      launching a website in September with further information about our work,
      but in the meantime you can read the review that led to our creation
      here: <https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/aicam> Our plan is to develop a
      programme of activities that help address the issues set out in this
      review.
    question: What is AI at cam?
  - answer: >-
      Amidst fevered conversations about progress in AI, the foundational work
      to connect technology development to public value is more important than
      ever. We face a cluster of complex challenges: recovering economic growth
      post-Covid; ensuring health and social care systems deliver for vulnerable
      people and patients; building resilience to the impacts of climate change;
      tackling pollution and biodiversity loss to enable environmental recovery;
      improving public service delivery in the context of strained resources;
      and more. Despite AI’s potential as a tool to help address these
      challenges, AI R&D is too often disconnected from public benefit.


      The University has an ambitious vision for AI that can deliver public benefit, which you can read in our [review](https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/aicam). To deliver on this vision, we need a new infrastructure for interdisciplinary AI innovation.


      Challenge-led research initiatives can galvanise the research community in support of priority issues and help build capability in areas of need. Inspired by these approaches, ai@cam is launching a cross-institutional research initiative focused on how Cambridge can leverage AI to help tackle today’s major scientific and societal challenges. We want to generate new thinking about the role of AI in addressing major challenges, build coalitions in areas of need, and create partnerships to take research from lab to real-world benefit. Research teams supported by the scheme will have access to funding and research support to scale their work and impact. This challenge-led research funding scheme is our first initiative, and we’ll launch further activities during the autumn and winter.
    question: Why have you launched this call?
  - answer: >-
      This call is open to staff at the University of Cambridge, working in any
      discipline, including natural, physical, biological, social, medical, and
      computer sciences, arts, humanities, and engineering. PhD students can
      also submit ideas, but please get permission from your supervisor first.


      At this stage, we’re looking for concept papers that set out an idea for challenge-led research that could deliver positive real-world outcomes through AI. You don’t need a fully developed research proposal to apply. For example, you might have the idea, but not yet have access to the tools or collaborators to develop and implement it. Alternatively, if you’d like to be involved in developing a challenge but don’t have a clear area of focus, check out the FAQ below about how you can get involved.
    question: Who can apply?
  - answer: "Today, we’re launching the first of a two-step process. We’re inviting
      concept papers with ideas for research that can help deliver ai@cam’s
      mission. The second step of this process will build research teams in
      thematic areas, scoping ambitious challenge-led programmes on those areas.
      The reason for working in two phases like this is to encourage
      collaboration: we know there is interest in AI from across the University,
      and world-leading expertise across departments, but it isn’t always easy
      to find collaborators, and we hope to facilitate this process."
    question: Wait what is this process?
  - answer: While this first stage of expressions of interest is focused on the
      research community within the University, we hope the resulting challenges
      will engage with external partners both in the UK and beyond. We’re
      particularly interested in engaging with communities affected by the
      development of AI and user groups with an interest in the design of AI
      systems. If you’re an external collaborator with an interest in ai@cam,
      you can sign up for updates about the
      mission [here](https://forms.gle/bAsKxnoY6E24DRTAA) or reach out to Jess
      Montgomery ([jkm40@cam.ac.uk](mailto:jkm40@cam.ac.uk)). Please bear with
      us while we’re in set-up phase; responses may take a little longer than
      usual.
    question: I'm not a researcher at the University of Cambridge. Can I get involved?
  - answer: After our roadmapping sessions, ai@cam will work with research teams to
      develop their idea into a challenge-led research initiative. We’ll start
      by providing start-up funding of up to £150k to help get the initiative
      off the ground. We expect this funding can be used flexibly, for example
      for research activities, equipment, staffing, teaching, or network
      building. We’ll host networking and engagement activities. We’ll provide
      support developing external connections and partnerships. We’ll also work
      with you on communications and profile-raising of the work. The exact
      package of support will be developed in collaboration with research teams
      as we develop the missions, and will flex over the two year period where
      we hope to help you launch your initiative.
    question: What support will ai@cam offer to these challenge lead programmes?
  - answer: At this stage, researchers are submitting ideas via the concept papers,
      with the expectation of a time commitment for workshops later in the
      project development process. Concept papers will be reviewed by the ai@cam
      team and clustered into themes. We’ll then bring together researchers
      within a theme to scope a challenge-led programme. Depending on the volume
      of interest in this call, this would be through either one or several
      workshops in the autumn and winter.
    question: What will happen to my concept paper?
  - answer: We anticipate offering start-up funds of £150k to selected challenges,
      working with those challenges to generate further income. Depending on the
      scale of demand, we may also launch a small-projects start-up scheme later
      this year. We’ll be using the concept paper and challenge scoping process
      to assess whether there is demand for this.
    question: What kind of funding do you expect to offer?
  - answer: ai@cam’s mission is to develop AI technologies that serve science,
      citizens, and society, and our focus is interdisciplinary research that
      addresses real-world challenges. We’re interested in projects that have a
      focus on public benefit, are trying to work across the pipeline from
      research to innovation and implementation, and that bring together
      expertise from across disciplines and user groups. Concept papers could
      relate to a new idea or build on an existing collaboration.
    question: What type of programmes doo you expect to offer?
  - answer: Funding will be deployable flexibly depending on the needs of the
      project. We will ask funding recipients to work with members of the ai@cam
      team to develop their projects, with a tailored support package. We
      anticipate working with challenges developed in this round for a two-year
      period, and for start-up funds to be deployed over this period. There may
      also be times over this period where we ask funding recipients to
      contribute to ai@cam events and comms activities.
    question: What are the terms and conditions of funding?
  - answer: To submit a concept note, visit <https://forms.gle/e6jBHyUdbZ3wBV2f7>
