  C2D3 seeks to create an interdisciplinary data science and AI community for
  Early Career Researchers (ECRs) and students, as a place for supporting
  researchers and their ideas, sharing solutions and networking. 


  This half-day conference will provide a forum to exchange ideas, discuss research problems and solutions, and make new connections. During the conference we will hear presentations from the C2D3 ECR Seed Fund Awardees (2023 and 2024) and lightning talks from the ECR and student community.

  ## Lightning Talk Abstracts


  We invite ECRs and Students to submit expressions of interest to present a lightning presentation.


  With a focus on interdisciplinary data science or AI research, there will be two themed lightning talk sessions. We invite you to submit an expression of interest to one of the themes and the Organising Committee will award the speaking slots. Each talk should be no more than 5 minutes long. We encourage the use of plenty of visual graphics, to help the audience digest your presentation and remember it for the networking session. Given the interdisciplinary nature of the conference, all talks should not go into too much technical detail. 


  Lightning talk themes


  * I have a solution to share  

  * I have a problem to solve 


  The Organising Committee will review the expressions of interest with the following criteria: 


  * Easily understandable abstract, not too technical 

  * Importance, novelty and impact in the field 

  * The research is interdisciplinary


  To apply to present a lightning talk please register your attendance on the link below, complete the attached “C2D3 Lightening talk expression of interest” template and return to Angela Godoy coordinator@c2d3.cam.ac.uk by **Weds 31st July 2024.**


  ## Organising Committee


  We are seeking expressions of interest to join the Organising Committee for this event. We are looking for enthusiastic individuals, from different departments and with a range of different skills. As a member of the organising committee, we would require you to screen the lightning talk submissions (a scoring template will be provided) and to be **available on the day** to fulfil the various roles; you can choose to chair a session, field questions, run the slido or provide IT technical support.


  Those chosen to join the Organising Committee can add this to their CV!  It is also a great opportunity to help decide the content of the day.


  Please email Angela Godoy at coordinator@c2d3.cam.ac.uk before **Weds 31st July 24** if you’d like to join us!
