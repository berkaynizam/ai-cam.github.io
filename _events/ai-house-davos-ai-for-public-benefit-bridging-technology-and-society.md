  We stand at a critical moment in the development of AI. Technical capabilities
  are advancing rapidly, but there is a persistent gap between these advances
  and their benefit to society.


  The public consistently calls for AI to be directed toward pressing societal challenges, such as healthcare, education, and climate change, yet AI often develops along paths disconnected from these needs.


  This panel brings together international voices to explore this critical challenge: how can we ensure AI serves science, citizens, and society? Drawing on insights from recent public dialogues and real-world experiences, we’ll examine what people expect from AI, the barriers to achieving this, and how to build innovation ecosystems that prioritize public benefit.


  **S﻿peakers:** Jessica Montgomery, Neil Lawrence, Godliver Owogomugisha and Vilas Dhar
