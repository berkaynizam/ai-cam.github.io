  Title: “Generative models as efficient surrogates for molecular dynamics simulations”


  Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) is an important simulation technique in the natural sciences and engineering. In principle, it allows for establishing detailed, mechanistic models of molecular systems to explain and design experiments, or engineer molecules towards desirable properties. Unfortunately, these simulations are prohibitively expensive to use on a large scale. In this talk, I will present our work on using Generative AI methods to accelerate these simulations by orders of magnitude.
