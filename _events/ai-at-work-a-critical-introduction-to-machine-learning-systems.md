  **Organiser:** Cambridge Digital Humanities


  Convenors: [Dr Anne Alexander](https://www.cdh.cam.ac.uk/about/people/dr-anne-alexander/) (CDH Director of Learning),[ Dr Emily Sandford](https://www.cai.cam.ac.uk/people/dr-emily-sandford) (Research Fellow, Gonville & Caius) and [Jarrah O’Neill](https://www.reprosoc.sociology.cam.ac.uk/directory/jarrah-oneill) (Reproductive Sociology Research Group)


  This in-person workshop will provide an accessible, non-technical introduction to Machine Learning systems, aimed primarily at graduate students and researchers in the humanities, arts and social sciences. No prior knowledge of programming is required.


  We will focus on the technical, ethical and societal implications of embedding Machine Learning systems for classifying and generating texts and images into the world of work, with a particular emphasis on the impact of Large Language Models such as ChatGPT. We will explore these text generation systems in the context of longer histories of AI, including the ‘deep learning revolution’ in image-based Machine Learning systems which laid the foundations for popular text-to-image generation models such as StableDiffusion.


  Participants will have the chance to both learn more about how AI works and also discuss what the embedding of such systems into labour processes, management structures, resource allocation systems may mean for how society works.
