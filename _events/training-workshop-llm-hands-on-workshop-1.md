  Accelerate Science are running a 1-day hands-on ML workshop to help you apply
  and develop further practical ML skills. This workshop will focus on Large
  Language Models (LLMs).


  During this workshop, you’ll work in teams on a real dataset of your choice, with support from Accelerate Science Machine Learning Engineers and researchers. You’ll need to work on building, tuning and evaluating LLMs for your chosen dataset - we have some dataset ideas to kick you off, or you can bring your own. This is an opportunity to work on real-life ML problems and data, and gain confidence in using tools that you can take back to your own domain and research project.


  This workshop is for people who are already confident with both ML fundamentals and Python programming. This isn’t a Python or ML introduction day - you’ll spend most of the day programming! We’ll use open-source libraries including HuggingFace and scikit-learn, so please come with a laptop and be prepared to get coding, before presenting your results to the group at the end of the day.
