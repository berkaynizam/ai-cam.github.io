  Researchers at the Bennett Institute for Public Policy and PolicyWISE have
  been examining the newly established the Council of Nations and Regions – the
  UK government’s new flagship intergovernmental initiative – offering
  recommendations to help shape its future direction.


  Their new report (to be co-published mid-May 2025) discusses the potential for improved relationships between the UK government, devolved governments, and English mayors through collaborative engagement. It details the need for a clearly defined purpose for the Council, the challenges of intergovernmental relations, and provides recommendations for its design and scope.


  **During this webinar, the authors will draw on their research to discuss:**


  * Collective governance – new ways of working across administrations

  * Strategic focus – the Council of Nations and Region’s remit and how it enables policy learning and coordination

  * The English question – who speaks for England and how is it represented?

  * Accountability – the role for parliaments and scrutiny


  There will be time for questions from the audience.

  * Professor Michael Kenny, Bennett Institute for Public Policy, University of Cambridge

  * Alex Walker, Bennett Institute for Public Policy, University of Cambridge
