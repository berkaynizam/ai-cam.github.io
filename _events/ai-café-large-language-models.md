  Are you using LLMs in your research, or considering doing so? Would you like
  to meet other researchers exploring the challenges and possibilities of
  deploying AI in research?


  Join the Accelerate team on Monday 22 July to hear short talks from researchers using LLMs in their work, followed by the opportunity to discuss your questions with an expert.


  Open to all University of Cambridge researchers, no need to sign up in advance. The event is taking place in West 2 at the West Hub.


  If you can’t make it on the day and would like support with using LLMs in your work, get in touch with the Accelerate team - accelerate-mle@cst.cam.ac.uk.
