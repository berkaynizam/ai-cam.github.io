  AI is the most rapidly advancing deep technology sector worldwide, offering
  immense potential to revolutionise entire industries, foster significant
  economic advancement, and reshape various aspects of everyday life. The
  transformative power of AI may be beneficial for individuals, communities and
  society at large. However, ensuring that AI initiatives yield positive

  consideration of AI ethics and safety. It is also crucial that science,
  industry and government work closely together to achieve this.


  AI is part of the Strategic Partnership between the University of Cambridge and the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU), established in 2018. The Cambridge Bavaria AI Conference aims to showcase University of Cambridge and LMU research driving forward our understanding of how to build innovative, safe, and trustworthy AI systems. It will explore research insights from the partnership, and the role of research, government and businesses to make sure the ecosystem is thriving and at the same time safe and inclusive.


  Confirmed speakers include Professor Neil Lawrence (Cambridge), Jessica Montgomery (Cambridge), Professor Anna Korhonen (Cambridge), Dr Kristin-Anne Rutter (Cambridge), Professor Björn Ommer (LMU), Dr Thomas Meier (LMU), Dr Marcel Gehrung (Cyted Health, Cambridge), Xavier Parkhouse-Parker (Cambridge Future Tech), Professor Jennifer Schooling (Anglia Ruskin University) and Angela-Sophia Gebert (Celonis).


  The event is also an initiative of the cooperation agreement between the United Kingdom and Bavaria, signed in September 2023. The AI conference should strengthen the exchange between British and Bavarian participants in the field of AI research and industry, in particular innovative SMEs and start-ups.


  This event will take place from 16:00 to 18:30 on 12 June in the Main Lecture Theatre at the Old Divinity School at St. John’s College (St Johns St, Cambridge CB2 1TP) and will be followed by a drinks reception.


  Attendance is free, but please register and secure your place.
