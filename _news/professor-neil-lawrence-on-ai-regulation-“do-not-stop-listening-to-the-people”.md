As part of a new video series on the UK General Election from the University of Cambridge, Prof Neil Lawrence, Chair for ai@cam, was asked what his message would be to the next Prime Minister on how to approach AI regulation.

“By all means listen to the big tech companies, listen to the big names, listen to the CEOs of these entities, but do not stop listening to the people, the public, and remember that your responsibility is to build a strong public sector that can regulate this technology for the benefit of the whole country, not just for the digital oligarchy.”

Prof Neil Lawrence warned that “we are sowing the seeds of 10,000 Horizon scandals” by a superficial approach to AI regulation. Prof Lawrence also touched upon the importance of the [Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3453) which he emphasised was “absolutely vital in controlling the larger companies.”

*What is at stake for the UK General Election* is a new video series from the University of Cambridge where students and academics share their insights on some of the biggest themes facing the UK, from AI to racial inequity, levelling up to misinformation, and first-time voting to tax changes.
