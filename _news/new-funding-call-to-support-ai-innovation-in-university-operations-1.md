ai@cam has launched a new funding call to support professional services teams across the University of Cambridge in deploying AI to improve the efficiency of operational processes. 

The call is part of its ai@cam’s AI for Operations programme and offers project grants of up to £10,000 for six-month sprints. Selected teams will also receive hands-on technical support and opportunities to share their learning across the University community.

“Professional services staff are eager to experiment with AI,” said Jess Montgomery, Director of ai@cam. “This programme will help them not just implement solutions, but share their successes and learn from each other. That’s how we’ll scale real impact across our administrative functions and create more responsive and efficient systems that better support our students and researchers.”

In addition to funding, successful applicants will benefit from digital support via monthly drop-in AI Clinics run by Accelerate Science’s machine learning engineers and peer learning opportunities. Alongside the project call, ai@cam is launching a series of community events to share learnings and outcomes across the University.

The new initiative builds on strong interest from professional services teams following ai@cam’s recent call for expressions of interest which revealed enthusiasm amongst staff to explore the use of AI across a variety of functions, from document processing and recruitment workflows to timetabling and content generation.

All projects proposed for the call will be assessed on their operational value, feasibility within the timeframe, and approach to ethical and risk considerations. Teams will not need prior AI expertise, but should demonstrate a willingness to learn and a clear understanding of the challenges they hope to address.

**How to apply:**Applications must be submitted via the [AI for Ops Funding Call](https://www.ai.cam.ac.uk/calls/ai-for-university-operations-project-funding-call) page by **12:00, Friday 29 August 2025.**
