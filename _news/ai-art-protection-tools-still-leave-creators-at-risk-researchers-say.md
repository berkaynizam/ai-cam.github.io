The University of Cambridge has launched a new Local Government AI Accelerator, offering grants of up to £25,000 for proof-of-concept projects that develop AI solutions in partnership with local authorities. The funding scheme aims to connect academic expertise with real operational needs in public services.

“Local authorities are increasingly exploring how AI might improve public services, but the pressures of day-to-day delivery make it difficult to trial ways of working with AI,” said Jessica Montgomery, Director of ai@cam. “This fund creates space for innovation by bringing together councils who understand the challenges with researchers who can help develop techniques or tools to support service delivery.”

Funded projects will run for 6–12 months and receive not only financial support but also access to monthly community-of-practice sessions, technical clinics with ai@cam engineers, and a final showcase to share lessons learned. The programme builds on ai@cam’s existing collaborations with councils across Cambridgeshire, where early AI applications are already demonstrating potential in areas such as social care, planning analysis and infrastructure maintenance.

“What makes this approach powerful is that the University serves as a convening space where councils can learn from each other while developing new solutions,” said Neil Lawrence, DeepMind Professor of Machine Learning and Chair of ai@cam. “It’s not only about individual projects - it’s about building a community of practice where local authorities can share challenges, compare approaches, and collectively advance what’s possible in public service delivery.”

**Community insights drive scheme requirements**

The scheme has been shaped by [ai@cam’s recent public dialogues](https://www.ai.cam.ac.uk/blog/what-local-government-needs-from-ai-learning-from-practice-in-our-ai-for-local-government-accelerator) with Cambridgeshire residents, which revealed cautious optimism about the role of AI in local government alongside clear expectations for its responsible use. Residents emphasised that AI should deliver tangible public benefit, strengthen rather than replace human judgment, and be introduced transparently with designs that remain accessible to all. Reflecting these priorities, applicants will be expected to use the public dialogue findings in developing their proposals, demonstrating how their projects uphold these principles.

The Accelerator is now open for applications from eligible Cambridge researchers working with at least one local authority partner. A Q&A information session will be held on 15 January, and applications must be submitted by 16:00 on Friday 13 February 2026.
