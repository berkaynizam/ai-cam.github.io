Three teams of early-career researchers have been named winners at the ai@cam’s first AI Sciencepreneurship Bootcamp, which challenged participants to turn cutting-edge research into startup ideas with real-world impact.

Taking home the Pitch Presentation Prize was *Nature Network*, presented by Susie McLaren, for her compelling delivery of a platform designed to connect the public with the natural world through an AI mapping tool.

“It was a privilege to take part in the bootcamp and share the vision behind *Nature Network*,” said McLaren. “The support and feedback from mentors and peers on crafting an effective pitch were invaluable and I’m excited to continue developing the idea and to be part of a community that’s passionate about using AI to make a real impact.”

Two ventures were jointly awarded the Project Prize for overall strength of innovation, technical insight, and commercial potential:

* *Ötzi*

   – Omer Nivron and Dan Andrei Iliescu
  An AI-driven tool to improve the accuracy and accessibility of climate-risk modelling for insurance markets, especially in the Global South.
* *From Womb to World*

   – Ekaterina (Kat) Moiseeva and Staci Meredith Weiss
  An AI-driven digital health tool designed to support parents and clinicians during IVF and high-risk pregnancies. The tool uses computer vision and advanced ultrasound imaging to track fetal development and identify developmental and infant health concerns.

The awards marked the finale of a two-day intensive programme hosted at the Møller Institute, where participants were given the tools and mentoring to explore entrepreneurship and build viable startup concepts rooted in AI.

Organised by ai@cam, the University’s flagship mission to drive a new wave of AI innovation that delivers public value, the bootcamp was designed to support PhD students, postdocs, and early-career researchers explore the commercial potential of their scientific innovations. Over the course of the bootcamp participants took part in workshops on business planning, received guidance from technical and industry experts, and prepared for a high-stakes pitch showcase judged by leaders from academia, venture capital, and industry  including Andrea Dimitracopoulos, Jessica Montgomery, Neil Lawrence, Ian Lane, Lauren Kisser and  Mahesh Santiapillai. 

Jessica Montgomery, Director of ai@cam, said: “This bootcamp was all about giving researchers the tools and confidence to explore entrepreneurship. It was fantastic to see such a diverse range of ideas, and to witness researchers communicate the potential of their work with real entrepreneurial energy. The quality of the pitches really demonstrated the strength of emerging talent in this space.”
