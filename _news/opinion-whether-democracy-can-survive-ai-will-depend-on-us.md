In my recent paper, [Can Democracy Survive AI](https://www.mctd.ac.uk/can-democracy-survive-ai-sociologica/), published on the heels of the UK’s [AI Opportunities Action Plan](http://www.mctd.ac.uk/ai-opportunities-action-plan-falls-short-of-challenges-of-tech-and-the-uk-economy/), I explain the fundamental challenges that AI poses to democracies.

As it exists now, AI innovation is accelerating centralisation and control, fuelling ideologies of trade-offs between regulation and economic growth, prioritising efficiency over accountability, and enabling absolute control coupled with unaccountable power. The story about AI that people are currently telling is one about economic growth and how technology will work for us.
