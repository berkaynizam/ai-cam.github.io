Meet Dawn, the most powerful AI supercomputer in the UK. With more than a thousand top-end Intel graphics processing units (GPUs) operating inside its server stacks, Dawn enables scientists within Cambridge and across the UK to make huge advances in critical research fields such as clean energy, personalised medicine and climate.

Dawn has been created via a highly innovative long-term co-design partnership between the University of Cambridge, UK Research & Innovation, the UK Atomic Energy Authority and global tech leaders Intel and Dell Technologies. This partnership brings highly valuable technology first-mover status and inward investment into the UK technology sector.

But what goes on under the bonnet of this AI supercomputer? Hilary Fletcher and Stephen Bevan take a closer look at two of the projects powered by Dawn, and their potential to benefit people’s lives around the globe.
