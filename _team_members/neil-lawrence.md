  at the University of Cambridge where he leads the University’s flagship
  mission on AI, AI@Cam. He has been working on machine learning models for over
  20 years. He recently returned to academia after three years as Director of
  Machine Learning at Amazon. His main interest is the interaction of machine
  learning with Chair for ai@camthe physical world. This interest was triggered
  by deploying machine learning in the African context, where ‘end-to-end’
  solutions are normally required. This has inspired new research directions at
  the interface of machine learning and systems research, this work is funded by
  a Senior AI Fellowship from the Alan Turing Institute. Neil is also visiting
  Professor at the University of Sheffield and the author of the book [The
