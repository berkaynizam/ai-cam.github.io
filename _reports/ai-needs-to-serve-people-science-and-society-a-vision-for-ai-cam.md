This report outlines the vision for ai@cam, examining how artificial intelligence can be leveraged to benefit science and society while addressing key challenges of equity and inclusion.

## Key Findings

The review revealed several critical aspects of AI development and deployment:

* AI is both a research domain and an accelerator of innovation across disciplines
* Translation of AI technology into practical benefit requires careful consideration
* Risks and benefits from AI innovations are unevenly distributed across society
* Development of safe AI requires expertise from multiple domains and stakeholders
* Digital divides must be addressed to ensure equitable benefit from AI advances

## Recommendations

The report puts forward several key recommendations for AI@Cam’s mission:

* Build partnerships between researchers, practitioners, and affected communities
* Develop new platforms for innovation and knowledge transfer
* Deliver interdisciplinary teaching and learning
* Build strong connections between the University and national AI priorities
* Focus on maintaining robust and equitable AI research ecosystem

## Cambridge’s Role

The University of Cambridge is a leading international university, which means it has a role in showing the way forward and enabling others to follow.

## The Way Forward

ai@cam recognizes that the University operates as both an engine of AI-enabled innovation and steward of those innovations. The mission focuses on building and maintaining the hygiene of a robust and equitable AI research ecosystem, ensuring that AI development serves the interests of science, citizens and society.
