This policy brief addresses three key questions regarding the UK’s approach to generative AI development and governance.

## Key Research Questions

1. What policy infrastructure and social capacity does the UK need to lead and manage deployment of responsible generative AI (over the long term)?
2. What national capability does the UK need for large-scale AI systems in the short- and medium-term?
3. What governance capacity does the UK need to deal with fast moving technologies, in which large uncertainties are a feature, not a bug?

## Key Findings

The research revealed several critical insights:

* UK should focus on becoming a leader in applying generative AI rather than building foundation models
* Existing national strengths in safe and ethical AI should be leveraged
* Supporting startups developing AI applications is more strategic than competing in model development
* Human safety and flourishing should be at the forefront of innovation
* Increased understanding and access to AI tools throughout society is crucial

## Policy Recommendations

Based on extensive research, the brief recommends:

* Create policy infrastructure for responsible AI deployment
* Develop governance capacity for fast-moving technologies
* Establish an AI Bill with clear ethical framework
* Support ecosystem of AI application startups
* Increase public understanding and access to AI tools

## Collaborative Approach

This policy brief represents a collaboration between three University of Cambridge groups:

* Bennett Institute for Public Policy
* Minderoo Centre for Technology and Democracy
* ai@cam
