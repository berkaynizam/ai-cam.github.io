abstract: This policy brief addresses whether the UK’s current approach to AI
  sovereignty is able to deliver a future where the nation can influence the AI
  systems shaping its economy, security, and democracy. The report highlights
  that while policy levers exist across different areas, the gaps between them
  create vulnerabilities and strategic dependencies. To build domestic AI
  capabilities that serve UK interests, a new, integrated approach is required,
  connecting research, industrial strategy, and procurement to create enduring
  capacity rather than temporary access to technology.

  ### Executive Summary


  ai@cam is the University of Cambridge’s mission to create AI innovations that serve science, citizens, and society. Our first year of operations has established the initiative as an incubator for interdisciplinary AI addressing real-world needs.


  ### Key Recommendations


  * Holistically examine the impact GenAI is having on the workforce in the creative industries, including by commissioning research on AI adoption across the sector, and use it to inform robust policies for supporting the sector’s workforce.

  * Encourage the uptake of licensing agreements to ensure copyright holders are compensated for use of their work by AI systems, but it should also ensure that these licensing agreements fully acknowledge the rights of copyright holders and fairly compensate them for the use of their works.

  * Independently ratify and adopt the Beijing Treaty on Audiovisual Performances as a first step in ensuring greater protections on performers’ rights and from false attribution by AI systems.

  * Adopt transparency requirements on the training of AI systems which include the mandatory disclosure of data provenance.

  * Clarify that only a human author will be afforded copyright in the outputs generated by AI models and produce guidance on: a) the threshold for ‘creative intellectual effort’ in achieving copyright in AI outputs; b) the need for recognition and compensation to artists whose name and canon are used in prompts to AI models that generate outputs; and c) measures required to avoid false attribution in AI outputs.

  * We urge caution against embarking on the path of a Text and Data Mining (TDM) exemption, regardless of an ‘opt-out’ mechanism, without a robust economic analysis of the impact that it will have on the creative industries.


  ### Key Achievements 2023-24


  * Launched five ambitious AI-deas research programmes across 19 Departments

  * Supported 46 HPC Pioneer Projects from 20 Departments

  * Generated over £190k in external income

  * Facilitated over 400 engagements with researchers, policymakers and public

  * Established Policy Lab connecting research to national priorities


  ### Progress Against Strategic Objectives


  ###### 1. Research Community Development


  AI-deas initiative launched 5 research programmes across mental health, fertility, public services, language equity, and climate HPC Pioneer Project scheme supported 46 research projects from 20 Departments Over 400 engagements with researchers, policymakers, and partners


  ###### 2. Partnerships and Ethics


  Collaborated with Kavli Centre for Ethics, Science, and the Public Conducted public dialogue workshops and citizen panels Developed policy briefs with Bennett Institute and Minderoo Centre


  ###### 3. Innovation Spaces


  Supported teams in accessing funding opportunities Connected researchers with compute resources Facilitated cross-departmental collaborations


  ###### 4. Knowledge Access


  Developed teaching and learning initiatives Supported early career researcher engagement Built connections with industry partners


  ###### 5. Policy Engagement


  Established Policy Lab connecting research to policy Contributed to AI Safety Summit discussions Engaged with local and national government


  ### Vision for the Future


  The University aspires to be:


  * A global force in AI research

  * A world-leader in education

  * An engine for innovation delivering social benefit


  This vision is built on three pillars:


  1. Growing research capability through cluster hiring

  2. Building world-class compute infrastructure

  3. Creating connections for real-world impact

**Key Findings**

* The UK’s investment strategy risks leading to **managed dependence**
*  rather than lasting AI sovereignty. Despite substantial supply-side investments in infrastructure and research, these actions sit alongside **deepening dependencies** on foreign AI systems.
* A **lack of policy integration** is the core challenge: innovation policy is disconnected from institutional adoption commitments, and industrial strategy insights are not linked to procurement policies.
* Current partnerships with major technology companies are structured as **access agreements** not capacity-building for domestic capabilities.
* The UK’s £2 billion AI investment is modest compared to the multi-billion-dollar commitments of other nations, requiring a highly focused strategic approach.

**Recommendations**

* **Make government an anchor customer for UK AI**

  : Public sector AI procurement, particularly by the NHS and government digital services, should include an assessment of whether spending builds UK capabilities or reinforces dependencies.
* **Use competition policy to keep markets contestable**

  : Prevent anti-competitive practices that lock customers into proprietary systems, creating space for UK alternatives.
* **Partner to build capacity, not only access near-term capabilities**

  : Restructure partnerships around knowledge transfer requirements and joint development programmes.
* **Support open-source AI development**

  : Connect open-source model development with public compute resources and institutional adoption to position the UK as a hub for open-source AI.

**Impact and Next Steps**

The UK possesses distinctive assets—**research excellence**, **regulatory credibility**, and **sectoral expertise** (like the NHS and finance sector)—that can be deployed to achieve sovereignty outcomes. A vision for UK AI should be grounded in delivering **public value**, ensuring AI systems improve public services, create economic benefits, protect critical infrastructure, and remain subject to democratic accountability.

Achieving this vision depends on establishing a focal point for **strategic coordination** that connects supply-side investments, defensive priorities, and demand-side decisions. Without this integration, substantial investments will fail to reduce strategic dependencies, and world-class research will lack the domestic adoption pathways necessary to build lasting capacity.
