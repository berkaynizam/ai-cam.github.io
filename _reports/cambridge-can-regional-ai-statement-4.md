  ### Executive Summary


  ai@cam is the University of Cambridge’s mission to create AI innovations that serve science, citizens, and society. Our first year of operations has established the initiative as an incubator for interdisciplinary AI addressing real-world needs.


  ### Key Recommendations


  * Holistically examine the impact GenAI is having on the workforce in the creative industries, including by commissioning research on AI adoption across the sector, and use it to inform robust policies for supporting the sector’s workforce.

  * Encourage the uptake of licensing agreements to ensure copyright holders are compensated for use of their work by AI systems, but it should also ensure that these licensing agreements fully acknowledge the rights of copyright holders and fairly compensate them for the use of their works.

  * Independently ratify and adopt the Beijing Treaty on Audiovisual Performances as a first step in ensuring greater protections on performers’ rights and from false attribution by AI systems.

  * Adopt transparency requirements on the training of AI systems which include the mandatory disclosure of data provenance.

  * Clarify that only a human author will be afforded copyright in the outputs generated by AI models and produce guidance on: a) the threshold for ‘creative intellectual effort’ in achieving copyright in AI outputs; b) the need for recognition and compensation to artists whose name and canon are used in prompts to AI models that generate outputs; and c) measures required to avoid false attribution in AI outputs.

  * We urge caution against embarking on the path of a Text and Data Mining (TDM) exemption, regardless of an ‘opt-out’ mechanism, without a robust economic analysis of the impact that it will have on the creative industries.


  ### Key Achievements 2023-24


  * Launched five ambitious AI-deas research programmes across 19 Departments

  * Supported 46 HPC Pioneer Projects from 20 Departments

  * Generated over £190k in external income

  * Facilitated over 400 engagements with researchers, policymakers and public

  * Established Policy Lab connecting research to national priorities


  ### Progress Against Strategic Objectives


  ###### 1. Research Community Development


  AI-deas initiative launched 5 research programmes across mental health, fertility, public services, language equity, and climate HPC Pioneer Project scheme supported 46 research projects from 20 Departments Over 400 engagements with researchers, policymakers, and partners


  ###### 2. Partnerships and Ethics


  Collaborated with Kavli Centre for Ethics, Science, and the Public Conducted public dialogue workshops and citizen panels Developed policy briefs with Bennett Institute and Minderoo Centre


  ###### 3. Innovation Spaces


  Supported teams in accessing funding opportunities Connected researchers with compute resources Facilitated cross-departmental collaborations


  ###### 4. Knowledge Access


  Developed teaching and learning initiatives Supported early career researcher engagement Built connections with industry partners


  ###### 5. Policy Engagement


  Established Policy Lab connecting research to policy Contributed to AI Safety Summit discussions Engaged with local and national government


  ### Vision for the Future


  The University aspires to be:


  * A global force in AI research

  * A world-leader in education

  * An engine for innovation delivering social benefit


  This vision is built on three pillars:


  1. Growing research capability through cluster hiring

  2. Building world-class compute infrastructure

  3. Creating connections for real-world impact

Cambridge’s AI ecosystem brings together world-leading research, industry innovation, and public sector implementation to deliver real-world impact for citizens while strengthening the UK’s global competitive position.

We are home to over 5,000 innovation-driven companies, including 120 AI powered companies who employ 13,000 people and have a combined turnover of £6bn, 36 research parks, five hospital trusts, two universities, and a thriving startup and investor community. The region can lead the way in bringing the UK’s vision for AI to life.

By working collaboratively across Cambridge’s AI ecosystem, we can strengthen the UK’s AI capabilities while ensuring the benefits spread to all parts of the nation. We have the academic expertise, the business community, and the civic infrastructure to be a global destination for AI innovation.

This regional AI Statement highlights the breadth AI activity happening across the Cambridgeshire region and represents our commitment to ensure AI development is responsible, inclusive, sustainable, and an engine for innovation that serves the public good.

We aim to foster connected communities by building AI capabilities across our region, widening access to the tools, knowledge, and know how which can focuse on delivering meaningful improvements to people’s lives.
